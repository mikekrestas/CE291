# Product Context
## Legal

Throughout the meetings, we have used varied information sources from different situations to
inspire our team’s unique ideas. We have used knowledge from websites to teach and inspire
ourselves in order to come up with simple, yet complex ideas regarding our product’s
development.

All data that is used and displayed as part of the product is collected from the UK government website (gov.co.uk), where all of the content used is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0 (OGL), which allows the copying, publishing, distribution and transmission of the Information; adapting of the Information; and exploiting the Information commercially and non-commercially, by including it in our own product or application.

A suitable license for the COVID-19 Prediction and Forecasting Tool would be a Copyleft FOSS license which grants use rights, but forbids proprietization.

In regards to data protection laws, Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) will be the key to implementing "Privacy by Design" in practice. A DPIA is a "systematic and extensive evaluation" of the personal data implications which are likely to arise in connection with a particular product.
Upon completion of a DPIA, as product developers we have a clear understanding of all personal data that is necessary for the functioning of the product or the delivery of the services, as well as the potential risks to the personal information. Steps can then be taken to mitigate the identified risks, even though there is minimal, if any, requirement of personal information from the user.

Whilst each case will be different, the approach to risk reduction will be to ensure that the product's functioning is aligned to the data processing principles (contained within Article 5 of the GDPR); some specific examples of which are:

- ensuring that the product only collects such information as is necessary for undertaking the functions or providing the services
- where possible, store the data in a format that prevents an individual from being identified, such as through the use of pseudonymisation
- seek to be transparent with the end user of the product but informing them explicitly and in plain language how their personal data will be used if they choose to engage with the product.

## Ethical

Ethical matters talk about the positive or negative impact our product may have on the customer and about our team’s handling procedure with the project itself. Even though the product's content, being a statistical analysis and prediction of death patterns and infection rates of COVID-19, could have a bigger negative impact on our customer, we tried to keep the information impersonal and unbiased by focusing on data and facts and presenting those in a professional manner with the intention of developing the product for research and recording purposes.

## Health & Safety

The General Product Safety Regulations 2005 (GPSR) require all products to be safe in their normal or reasonably foreseeable usage and enforcement authorities have powers to take appropriate action when this obligation isn’t met.

In regards to physical health and safety, mainly due to our reliance on simulations and the more theoretical/abstract aspects of the project, the software itself poses no risk. The GUI was kept minimalistic, easy-to-use and suitable for a range of different users, because it features no flashing images, bright colors or any other detterents.
