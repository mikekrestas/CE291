## Project Management Discussion

The group’s effort and progress is consistent. Communication is fine and the members consult each other on any hardship they encounter. The tasks are equally shared so the group does not lose time with the members falling short of the required skills. The team had full-attendance on regular team-meetings on Friday in the first term and wednesday in the second mostly and never had a session with missing more than one person at a time. The overall progression is satisfactory. The data is neatly printed and sorted. Option of displaying the data on line graph is working. Linear regressive prediction is accurate.

Regular scrum meetings include exchange of ideas, evaluation of the weekly sprint and the review of the tasks done, all the completed tasks are presented by the member responsible and approved by the group before moving to the “done” section on Jira. The progress is a clear sign that the approach is working but efficiency would be improved if the group does not wait until scrum meeting and review to complete a task. 
Overall, the communication was excellent, only improvement would be the better use of Jira. It would be used more efficiently by uploading a document/comment/screenshot of the task before completing it. 

Thanks to the great attendance rate of the team, the stand-up meeting was not necessary in the first term. The group had one stand-up meeting on week 9 with the all member attending to finalise the first half of the project and exchanging ideas on presenting. Over the course of the two-hour meeting, MVP documents on gitLab is approved, the powerpoint presentation is prepared and the section of the slide are shared for presentation.

On February 3, 2021, the team held a stand-up meeting as instructed in moodle under Sprint 6. The meeting revolved around three critical question;

1. What did I work on yesterday?
2. What am I working on today?
3. Which issues are blocking me?

Standup meeting demonstrated the workflow of the members. Each team member read the answers of the other members and talked about the sticking points. The standup meeting was effective, after the meeting, it became clear that how the remaining parts should be shared. The team tackled the most important problems in the following two weeks after the meeting.

Each team member answered the question above and recorded on jira. The burndown of the meeting and details can be seen below, answers are reachable via the link.

## Burndown-Charts Discussion

Overall, the team applied the agreed road map for the week on Jira. Over the week we worked on our appointed tasks and during the meetings on friday laboratories, we talked about our progress on a given task. If the end result is satisfactory and approved by the team, the task is marked as approved and moved to the completed section.
